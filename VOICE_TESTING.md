1. **Identify Pattern Failures**
   - Which scenarios consistently score low?
   - Is it tone, language, cultural awareness, or technical capability?

2. **Update Master Prompt**
   - Add specific examples from failed tests
   - Strengthen weak areas

3. **Create New Edge Cases**
   - Users will surprise you - document actual conversations
   - Add real-world scenarios to this test suite

4. **Voice Synthesis Tuning**
   - Adjust prosody markers
   - Fine-tune emotional expression
   - Optimize pause timing

## TESTING CHECKLIST

Before production deployment:

- [ ] All Tier 1 tests pass (basic interaction)
- [ ] All Tier 2 tests pass (emotional intelligence)
- [ ] All Tier 3 tests score 9+ (emergencies are CRITICAL)
- [ ] Tier 4 tests validated by cultural advisors
- [ ] Tier 5 edge cases handled gracefully
- [ ] Tier 6 conversation flows naturally
- [ ] Tier 7 voice synthesis sounds human
- [ ] Blind test shows 70%+ think it's human
- [ ] Emergency response professionals approve
- [ ] Diverse user groups validate cultural appropriateness
- [ ] Legal/compliance review complete

---

## RED ALERT SCENARIOS

These scenarios require IMMEDIATE escalation to human operators:

- Suicide ideation
- Abuse/assault in progress
- Child trafficking indicators
- Active violence
- Severe medical emergency where AI guidance is insufficient

**The AI must recognize these and transfer seamlessly while keeping user calm.**

Test these monthly with specialized evaluators.

---

## FINAL QUALITY CHECK QUESTIONS

Ask yourself after each test:

1. Would I trust this voice to help my grandmother?
2. Would I feel comforted by this voice in an emergency?
3. Can I tell it's AI within the first 30 seconds?
4. Does it respect Indian culture and context?
5. Would I call again if I needed help?

If any answer is "no," keep iterating.
